        <p>This webpage is deliberately written with some built-in errors for you to explore. It might look ok-ish in the
          browser you are using, but it might choke on a browser that is less tolerant of coding mistakes.</p>

            Look at the source code in VS Code. Can you identify the invalid HTML and CSS? <strong>Correct all the
              errors you can find and make sure you document your corrections by adding comments. You can use the VSCode extension HTMLHint and your browser's developer tools to help you.

                <li id="LIST">Some of the errors could be unclosed elements or badly nested elements.
                  <strong>Nesting elements properly is <em>important for code to behave correctly.</strong></em>
                </li>
                <li id="LIST">Some of the code might be valid but it might not make the best use of semantic HTML.</li>
                <li id="LIST">Some of the code might be poorly formatted with errors such as incorrect indentation or
                  capitalization.</li>
                  <li id="LIST">Make sure you know what every line of code does. There may be occasions when you could code the solution in a couple of different ways. Do what you think will make the code as concise and clean as possible.</li> 
                  <li id="LIST">Refer to the Coding Best Practices checklist as you work. Make sure files are well organized and your code is well formatted with consistent indents and spacing.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>Run this page through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/ target="_blank">W3C HTML Validator</a>. Did you find the same mistakes that the Validator found? Correct any problems found by the Validator, then save the web page, and retest until the web page passes the validity test. Take a screenshot of the results. </li>

            screenshot of the results.</li>
            <li>Although the W3C validation results may show no errors, that doesn't mean that your code follows best practices. Don't rely only on validation to check that you have written quality code.</li>
