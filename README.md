# Assignment 5 - Coding Best Practices

This is your remote assignment 5 repository readme file. You are seeing this file because you have successfully accepted the assignment link and GitHub automatically created a remote repository for you. Now you can complete the assignment steps below.

## Objectives

You will use the work you created for assignment 4 and add the provided HTML page to it, you will then correct the errors in the provided HTML and CSS and use the CSS box model to improve the layout of the page. The goal of this assignment is to practice debugging invalid code, applying formatting best practices and using the CSS box model properties. 


## Requirements

Here's a list of the things that I'd like you to include in this week's assignment:

1. Copy all the files from assignment 4 into your assignment 5 local repo.
2. Include a link to `ass5.html` called "Assignment 5" in the navigation bar on all the pages in your repo. 
3. Follow the instructions in the provided `ass5.html` to correct all the HTML errors that you can find. Make sure you document what you corrected and why you corrected it by adding comments to the file.
4. Add CSS styles to make `ass5.html` look like the image below. Your styles can be embbedded or external but they should only affect ass5.html. You should be able to accomplish the layout in the image using only a few lines of CSS, none of the HTML should need editing:
